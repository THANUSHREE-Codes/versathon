// HashChangeEvent is a built-in event in JavaScript that is fired when the fragment identifier of the URL (the part after the # symbol) changes. This event is commonly used in single-page applications (SPAs) to detect changes in the URL and update the content accordingly without reloading the page.

// Here's an example of how to use the HashChangeEvent in JavaScript:```javascript// Listen for the hashchange event
// window.addEventListener('hashchange', function() {
//     console.log('The hash has changed to: ' + window.location.hash);
// });
